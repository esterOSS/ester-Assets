 - This is an Arch distro
 - It uses Gnome<sup>visually appealing edition (not really, just some extensions added into GNOME)</sup>
	 - Has a custom made icon pack
	 - Has a custom boot animation
	 - Has a custom font
	 - Has custom wallpapers
	 - ***DOES*** have custom apps
 - It is indeed real. (Atleast on the PC and soon on Android under the name OriginUi  `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`)
